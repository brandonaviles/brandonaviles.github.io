      <p>Brandon Aviles brings you the playlist that we'll be listening to and talking about for years. As enigmatic as its author, these albums
        'Blonde' by Frank Ocean, 'Based on a Feeling' by Sabrina Claudio, and 'Souled Out' by Jhené Aiko is a daring set of ambient post and present R&B
        that slips into your bloodstream. Through its rich story-telling, these once in a lifetime artist have created luxorious word-play and melody that 
        these artists favor. From mood-altering moves of 'Nights' by Frank Ocean, to (literally) being transported to the ocean with Jhené Aiko's 
        coastal beach vibes of 'Spotless Mind'; and finally, to your bedrooms relaxtion with Sabrina Claudio' 'Don't Make Me Wait'. These albums 
        will definitely keep you wanting more.
