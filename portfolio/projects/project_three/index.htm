                <h2>Mediterranean Dinner</h2>
                <p>The Mediterranean diet refers to a way of eating that focuses on the traditional foods eaten in the
                    countries
                    that surround the Mediterranean Sea. This style of eating emphasizes plant foods, incorporates some
                    animal
                    foodsâ€”in particular, fish, and sparingly includes sweets,
                    red meat and processed meats.</p>

                <h2>Steak and Fries</h2>
                <p>Steak frites is a dish of steak cut into strips and fried with butter and garlic until browned, and
                    served with
                    French fries. Steak frites are simply steak and French fries (frites), but they can connote an
                    entire dish or meal.</p>
